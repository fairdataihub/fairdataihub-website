          You can start by either Creating a CHANGES file from scratch with SODA
          or Continue working on an existing CHANGES.txt file.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to continue working on an existing CHANGES.txt file, you
          will be prompted to either import it from your computer, or specify a
          Pennsieve dataset where the file is currently located. SODA will load
          information from such CHANGES file for further edits at your
          convenience.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the text-area, enter the information to be included in your
          CHANGES.txt file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review and click on <strong>"Generate"</strong> to generate your
          CHANGES file. You have the options to generate and save it on your
          computer or generate and upload it to Pennsieve. The generated file
          will be ready to be included in your dataset.
