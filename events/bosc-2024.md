We are delighted to join BOSC for the third time. We will discuss [Codefair](/codefair), a GitHub app we developing for easily making research software FAIR. [Dorian Portillo](/team#Dorian-Portillo) will present a poster on the same topic. More details are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fairdataihub/codefair-BOSC-2024).

## About the Conference

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been held annually since 2000. BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.
