The FAIR Data Innovations Hub team will be at the Bridge2AI All Hands Conference with colleagues from the AI-READI project to discuss our progress on the project and especially discuss the data we have collected so far and how it will be available to other researchers.

## About the All Hands Conference

The April 2024 Bridge2AI All Hands Conference will be an opportunity for researchers and experts to engage in vibrant discussions. The NIH Common Fund’s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that tackles complex biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. The biomedical research community generates a wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the Bridge2AI program will help bring solutions to this deficit.
