We are delighted to join OBFâ€™s CoFest for the second time after 2022. We have introduced the FAIR-BioRS guidelines as a topic for the CoFest so we are really looking forward to discussing the guidelines with members of the community. We are also looking forward to contributing to the other great topics.

## About the CoFest

In conjunction with our annual meeting, BOSC, the OBF runs a collaborative event (formerly called CodeFest, short for coding festival, and now called CollaborationFest, or CoFest for short). At these events, participants work together to contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases.
