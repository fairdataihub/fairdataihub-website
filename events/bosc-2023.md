We are delighted to join BOSC for the second time after 2022. We will discuss the FAIR-BioRS guidelines through a talk titled `FAIR-BioRS: Actionable guidelines for making biomedical research software FAIR` as well as a poster on the same topic.

## About the Conference

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been held annually since 2000. BOSC is organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community. Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSCâ€™s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.
